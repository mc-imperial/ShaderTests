This test case is pathological enough to not fit well as a CTS test. It still serves as a good example of a case that makes Mesa/Intel run out of memory surprisingly easy. The driver causes an out of host memory error but redirecting cerr to /dev/null one can hit coverage points related to shader printing. The code path for the coverage points hit is supposedly only for error cases like this.
