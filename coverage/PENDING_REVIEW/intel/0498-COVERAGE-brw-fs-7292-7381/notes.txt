Here is another test case with lots of nested loops. These are different than the previous ones because the global loop counter incrementation is outside the for loop declaration and a struct is used in the inner loop. The coverage points are hit because Intel/Mesa driver encounters an out of memory situation, but the test itself still makes sense although the number of loops are quite pathological.
